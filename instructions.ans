 This program simulates a trip over the Oregon Trail from Independence Missouri
 to Oregon City, Oregon in 1847.

 Your family of five will cover the 2040 mile Oregon Trail in 5-6 months...

 ...If you make it alive.

 You had saved $900 to spend for the trip, and you've just paid $200 for a
 wagon.

 You will need to spend the rest of your money on the following items:

[10C[1mOxen[0m - You can spend $200-$300 on your team, the more you spend the
[17Cfaster you'll go because you'll have better animals.

[10C[1mFood [0m- The more you have the less chance there is of getting sick.

    [1mAmmunition[0m - $1 buys a belt of 50 bullets. You will need bullets for
[17Cattacks by animals and bandits, and for hunting for food.

    [1m  Clothing[0m - This is especially important for the cold weather you will
[17Cencounter when crossing the mountains.

[1m Misc Supplies [0m- This includes medicine and other things you will need for
[17Csickness and emergency repairs.

 You can spend all your money before you start your trip - or you can save
 some of your cash to spend at forts along the way when you run low. However,
 items cost more at forts. You can also go hunting along the way to get more
 food.

 Whenever you have to use your trusty rifle along the way, you will be told
 to type in a word (one that sounds like a gun shot). The faster you type in
 that word and hit the [1mRETURN[0m key, the better luck you'll have with your gun.

 At each turn, all items are shown in dollar amounts except bullets.

 When asked to enter money amounts, don't use a [1m$[0m.

 Good Luck!!!
